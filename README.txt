Opioid usage among pregnant women is not reccomended. This analysis looks into the trends in opioid
prescribing habits among the privately insured pregnant women. We focus on the first pregnancy of these
women, but future work will focus on subsequent births. We also remove those women who are in MAT (Medication
Assisted Treatment) for opioid abuse disorders. These women should continue their therapy to 
prevent relapse to opioid abuse. 

This is early SAS code on my part and as such is not very elegant. However, this was work with the 
Pharmetrics Plus LifeLink Database. Our findings indicate that women do reduce use of opioids when 
they become pregnant. More importantly, the trend has been decreasing since before peak opioid, a
good result to find in the midst of a national tragedy.
